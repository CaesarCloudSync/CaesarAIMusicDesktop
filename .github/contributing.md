# Contributing Guide for Nora

First off, Thank you for deciding to contribute to Nora. It's people like you that make Nora live a long time.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Types of contributions

> Nora is an open source project and I'd love to receive contributions from the community. These can be bug reports, feature requests or writing code to resolve already existing issues.

## Ground Rules

> **Responsibilities**
>
> - Ensure compatibility for Windows and Linux for every change that's accepted.
> - Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> - Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.

## Getting started

> First, always check the Issues panel whether your issue has been already added by another contributor.

#### **For something that is bigger than a few lines:**

> 1.  Create your own fork of the code
> 2.  Do the changes in your fork
> 3.  If you like the change and think the project could use it, create a pull request.
> 4.  Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
